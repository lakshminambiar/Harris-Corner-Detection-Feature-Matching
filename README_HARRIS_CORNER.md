# Harris-Corner-Detection & Feature-Matching using keypoints from Harris-Corner
 This repository shows how to extract/get keypoints from Harris corner algorithm using cv2 library.
 Import necessary libraries from harris_corner_detection_requirements.txt.
 Read reference and target images using cv2 library.
 Convert target and reference images to grayscale.
 Implement Harris corner detection algorithm.
 Get keypoints of both target and reference image from the detection algorithm step.
 Pass the keypoints obtained from the step 6 to orb.compute() and perform feature matching.
